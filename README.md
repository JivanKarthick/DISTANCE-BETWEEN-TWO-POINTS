## DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS
## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

ALGORITHM:
## Step 1:
Import math function

## Step 2:
Assign the values of point 1 and point 2 whose distance is to be calculated.

## Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula formula

## Step 4:
Print the coding to get the answer.

## Step 5:
End the program.
### PROGRAM:

import math as np
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=np.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
